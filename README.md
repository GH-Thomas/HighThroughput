# HighThroughput
Repository to store all of my work for my Monte Carlo Simulation project. Admittedly crude, this is just to have these (very old) files publically viewable - albeit not in a particularly digestible form.

If you're a recruiter looking for more of a demo, the Colloquium project is also on my resume and readily available to try out.
